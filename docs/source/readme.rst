In its current state, ``geefetch`` allows you to download Sentinel-1,
Sentinel-2, Dynamic World data as raster files, and GEDI data as raster
or vector files. See ``geefetch download --help``.

Adding autocompletion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add autocompletion for the ``geefetch`` CLI, following
`click's doc <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/>`__.

If you are using a ``conda`` environment, you need to activate
autocompletion in that environment only. Following the instructions in
`the
doc <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#macos-and-linux>`__,
add the following command to
``$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh`` (adapt for other
shell than ``zsh``)

.. code:: bash

   eval "$(_GEEFETCH_COMPLETE=zsh_source geefetch)"
